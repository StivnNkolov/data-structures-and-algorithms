"""
Binary trees are data structures in which each node has at most two children,
often referred to as the left and right children.

Binary tree is a family of data structure(BST, Heap tree, AVL, red black trees)
Their basic property is derived from binary tree.
Binary trees are prerequisite for mode advanced trees.

Full binary tree: if each node has zero or two children (but not one) it is
full binary tree.
Perfect binary tree: All non-leaf nodes have two children, and they are at the same
depth.
Complete binary tree: All levels are completely filled except the last level.
Balanced binary tree: Each leaf is not more than a certain distance from
the root node than any other leaf. All leaf nodes are located from the root
in the same distance.

We have 4 types of traversal.
